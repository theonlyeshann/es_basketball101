        Basketball is a team sport, and passing is what makes the team work together. Great passers 
        can see plays develop before they happen and deliver the ball exactly where and when their 
        teammates need it. Work on different types of passes: chest pass, bounce pass, overhead pass, 
        and always pass with purpose.
