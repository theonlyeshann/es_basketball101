    <h2> â€¢ FITNESS </h2>
    
    <p> To perform well in any sport, an athlete must have a fitness level higher than the ones of an average person. For basketball players, they need to have elevated levels of: </p> 

  <ul>
    <li> Speed </li> 
    <li> Resistance </li>
    <li> Strength </li>
    <li> Flexibility </li> 
  </ul>
    
    <p> To train these, you must work your body specifically to achieve the increase of these physical qualities. Stepping foot on the court is the easiest part, but performing well consistenly comes down to how much physical exertion your body can take. </p>

    <p> Off the court, work progressively towards running quicker in short bursts, as well as running at a consistent pace for longer periods of time. This will increase your speed as well as endurance and resistance. </p>

    <p> Get in the weight room and increase the strength of your muscles. Prioritize the muscle groups depending on your weak points, but below is a general order which you can follow in case you need reference: </p>

    <ol>
      <li> Core (Lower and Upper Torso) </li>
      <li> Lower Body (Quads, Hamstrings, Glutes, Calves) </li> 
      <li> Upper Body (Shoulders, Chest) </li>
    </ol>

    <p> As you progressively get better at working these muscle groups, and are able to manage them well with your bodyweight, begin adding weights to increase your strength. Your strength will increase by doing so. </p>

    <p> A major part of exercise that is overlooked is recovery. Even if you feel like you can workout everyday, you need to give your body time to recover and repair itself. Recovery days are those days when you can focus highly on increasing your flexibility. </p>

    <p> By working on your fitness, you will feel more comfortable to work on the fundamentals of basketball. Never stop working out, however, it is very hard to build high athletic capacity, and extremely easy to lose it. Don't waste your efforts. </p>
